HTML email made accessible over HTTP

This is simply a project for _exploring_ how to make HTML emails available over HTTP.

The initial idea is to access the mail in a mailbox via IMAP, pull the HTML portion out store that on a filesystem and 
serve it over HTTP.

Note the emphasis on _exploring_. That means this code is not for production use. It may not even work. It may ot it 
may not evolve to something more useful on the future.
